  <p>Hello! I am a senior math major (minors: chemistry, French) at the University of South Carolina. My advisor at UofSC is Professor Joshua Cooper. I am currently doing research in discrete geometry under Dr. Cosmin Pohoata in the SUMRY NSF-REU at Yale University. In Spring of 2022, I studied in the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics program. While there, I did research in rigidity theory with a phenomenal team of other undergrads (Henry Simmons, <a href="https://zeyu-zheng.github.io/"> Zeyu Zheng</a>) under Professor Tibor Jordán.
    <br>
 In the Fall 2022 semester, I am applying to graduate schools and for the NSF-GRFP. I'm also taking my first "official" graduate course (with other graduate students). Advice on any of these pursuits is welcome!

  ## Coursework

  <ul type="circle">
    <li>my favorite math course I've taken as of Summer 2022 is Discrete and Convex Geometry in Budapest under Professor Gergely Ambrus. This course covered Helly's Theorem, Radon's Theorem, Carathéodory's Theorem, along with a sizable section on incidence problems, including a proof of the Szemerédi-Trotter theorem by my professor, Prof. Lázslo Székely. I also first met the Geometric Erdős-Szekeres theorem and its lovely proof in this course. You can see the theorem and its proof (extracted from Prof. Ambrus' course notes) here. 
    </li>
    <li>in Fall 2021, Professor Michael Filaseta (UofSC) graciously came out of his recent retirement to teach me the majority of the content of his graduate course notes in Number Theory  </li>
    <li>my other BSM Courses include Research (Tibor Jordán, ELTE, A), Mathematical Problem Solving (Sándor Dobos, A), Measure Theory (Péter Maga, Rényi Institute, B+)</li>
    <li>my other UofSC courses are listed here with professors and grades parenthesized: Mathematical Foundations of Network Science (Lincoln Lu, A),  Analysis (Ralph Howard, A), Abstract Algebra II (Matt Miller, A), Abstract Algebra I (Matt Miller, A), Discrete Mathematics (Lázsló Székely, A), Vector Analysis (Frank Thorne, A), Linear Algebra (Anton Schep, B+), Transition to Advanced Mathematics (Matt Miller, A).   </li>
