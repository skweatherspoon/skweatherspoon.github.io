# Kaylee Weatherspoon

Hello! I am a rising senior majoring in mathematics (minors: chemistry, French) at the University of South Carolina. My advisor at UofSC is Professor Joshua Cooper. I am currently doing research in discrete geometry under Dr. Cosmin Pohoata in the SUMRY NSF-REU at Yale University. In Spring of 2022, I studied in the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics program. While there, I did research in rigidity theory with a phenomenal team of other undergrads (Henry Simmons, <a href="https://zeyu-zheng.github.io/"> Zeyu Zheng</a>) under Professor Tibor Jordán.
