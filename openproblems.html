                   Hi again! This is a list of some of my favorite open problems. Those with the symbol &#127793; next to them are, to my knowledge, mine.
                   I welcome any corrections, ideas, or opportunities for collaboration!
            </p>
      
      
   <h2> Rigidity Theory </h2> 
        <ol type="1">
    <li> &#127793; What are the rigid graphs whose complement is also rigid? Note that by Laman's Theorem, such a graph must have at least 8 vertices. 
          It may be advantageous to consider minimally rigid graphs. 
              </li>
    <li> &#127793; For k-vertex/edge (global) rigidity, what are the graphs G so that all minors of G maintain the given rigidity property? </li>
    <li> &#127793; What are the minimally rigid graphs in \mathbb{R}^3 for which the deletion of a single vertex yields a minimally rigid graph in \mathbb{R}^2?
              Do such graphs exist?</li>
  </ol>
                
      <h2> Topological Graph Theory </h2> 
      <ol type="1">
    <li> Is every arrangement graph of a set of great circles 3-colorable? Given that Hadwiger's conjecture holds for n=4, showing that such graphs have
          no minor of chromatic number 4 would resolve this question.
