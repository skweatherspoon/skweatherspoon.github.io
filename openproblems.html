                <p style="font-size: 26px">Hello! I am a senior math major (minors: chemistry, French) at the University of South Carolina. My advisor at UofSC is Professor Joshua Cooper. Last summer, I did research in discrete geometry under Dr. Cosmin Pohoata in the SUMRY NSF-REU at Yale University. In Spring of 2022, I studied in the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics program. While there, I did research in rigidity theory with a phenomenal team of other undergrads (Henry Simmons, <a href="https://zeyu-zheng.github.io/"> Zeyu Zheng</a>) under Professor Tibor Jord√°n.
    <br>
 In the Fall 2022 semester, I am applying to graduate schools and for the NSF-GRFP. I'm also taking my first "official" graduate courses (with other graduate students). Advice on any of these pursuits is welcome!
