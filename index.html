                <p style="font-size: 26px">Hello! I am a senior math major (minors: chemistry, French) at the University of South Carolina. My advisor at UofSC is Professor Joshua Cooper. Last summer, I did research in discrete geometry under Dr. Cosmin Pohoata in the SUMRY NSF-REU at Yale University. In Spring of 2022, I studied in the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics program. While there, I did research in rigidity theory with a phenomenal team of other undergrads (Henry Simmons, <a href="https://zeyu-zheng.github.io/"> Zeyu Zheng</a>) under Professor Tibor Jordán.
    <br>
 In the Fall 2022 semester, I am applying to graduate schools and for the NSF-GRFP. I'm also taking my first "official" graduate courses (with other graduate students). Advice on any of these pursuits is welcome!

  <h2> Research </h2>
  
  <ol type="1">
    <li> Yale SUMRY NSF-REU: Variants of Heilbronn's Triangle Problem </li>
    <li> Budapest Semesters in Mathematics:  <a href="main_June28 (1).pdf">Rigidity Properties of 4-Regular Graphs</a> (submitted to Discrete Mathematics) </li>
    <li> Auburn NSF-REU in Discrete Math: (1) A Generalization of Szlam's Lemma (published in Geombinatorics), (2) On the Epsilon Chromatic Number of the Plane, (3) On the Hoffman metric for Graphs </li>

 <h2> Coursework </h2>

  <ul type="circle">
    <li>my favorite math course I've taken as of Summer 2022 is <b>Discrete and Convex Geometry</b> in Budapest under Professor Gergely Ambrus. This course covered Helly's Theorem, Radon's Theorem, Carathéodory's Theorem, along with a sizable section on incidence problems, including a proof of the Szemerédi-Trotter theorem by my UofSC professor, Prof. Lázslo Székely. I also first met the Geometric Erdős-Szekeres theorem and its lovely proof in this course. You can see the theorem and its proof (extracted from Prof. Ambrus' course notes) <a href="Geometric Erdos-Szekeres.png"> here</a>. 
    </li>
    <li>in Fall 2021, Professor Michael Filaseta (UofSC) graciously came out of his recent retirement to teach me the majority of the content of his graduate course notes in <b>Number Theory</b>  </li>
    <li>my other math courses are as follows, with my professors and grades parenthesized:<b>Thesis Preparation</b> (Joshua Cooper, in progress), <b>Formalization and Mathematics</b> (Matthew R. Ballard, in progress), <b>Graduate Discrete Mathematics II</b> (Lászlo Székely, in progress), <b>Graduate Discrete Mathematics I</b> (Lászlo Székely, A), <b>Graduate Abstract Algebra</b> (Alexander Duncan, A), <b>Discrete Optimization</b> (Joshua Cooper, A) <b>Research</b> (Tibor Jordán, ELTE, A), <b>Mathematical Problem Solving </b> (Sándor Dobos, A), <b>Measure Theory</b> (Péter Maga, Rényi Institute, B+), <b>Mathematical Foundations of Network Science</b> (Lincoln Lu, A),  <b>Analysis</b> (Ralph Howard, A), <b>Abstract Algebra II</b> (Matt Miller, A), <b>Abstract Algebra I</b> (Matt Miller, A), <b>Discrete Mathematics</b> (Lázsló Székely, A), <b>Vector Analysis</b> (Frank Thorne, A), <b>Linear Algebra</b> (Anton Schep, B+), <b>Transition to Advanced Mathematics</b> (Matt Miller, A).   </li>
