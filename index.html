                <p style="font-size: 26px">Hello! I am a senior math major (minors: chemistry, French) at the University of South Carolina. My advisor at UofSC is Professor Joshua Cooper. Last summer, I did research in discrete geometry in the SUMRY NSF-REU at Yale University. In Spring of 2022, I studied in the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics program. While there, I did research in rigidity theory with a phenomenal team of other undergrads (Henry Simmons, <a href="https://zeyu-zheng.github.io/"> Zeyu Zheng</a>) under Professor Tibor Jordán.
    <br>
                      In Spring 2023, I am taking a second semester of Graduate Discrete Mathematics, completing my Honors Thesis, and compiling my <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gld-in-research/about-me">portfolio</a> to 
                      graduate with Leadership Distinction in Research. I am absolutely thrilled to be participating in the Women and Mathematics summer school at the 
                      Institute for Advanced Study in May and the Discrete and Convex Geometry summer school at the Erdős Center (extension of the Rényi Institute) in August. 
                      In Fall 2023, I will be a Ph.D. student at Rutgers. Advice related to any of these pursuits is welcome!

 <h2> Coursework </h2>

  <ul type="circle">
    <li>my favorite math course I've taken as of Summer 2022 is <b>Discrete and Convex Geometry</b> in Budapest under Professor Gergely Ambrus. This course covered Helly's Theorem, Radon's Theorem, Carathéodory's Theorem, along with a sizable section on incidence problems, including a proof of the Szemerédi-Trotter theorem by my UofSC professor, Prof. Lázslo Székely. I also first met the Geometric Erdős-Szekeres theorem and its lovely proof in this course. You can see the theorem and its proof (extracted from Prof. Ambrus' course notes) <a href="Geometric Erdos-Szekeres.png"> here</a>. 
    </li>
        <br>
    <li>in Fall 2021, Professor Michael Filaseta (UofSC) graciously came out of his recent retirement to teach me the majority of the content of his graduate course notes in <b>Number Theory</b>  </li>
   <br>
        <li>my other math courses are as follows, with my professors and grades parenthesized:<b>Thesis Preparation</b> (Joshua Cooper, in progress), <b>Formalization and Mathematics</b> (Matthew R. Ballard, in progress), <b>Graduate Discrete Mathematics II</b> (Lászlo Székely, in progress), <b>Graduate Discrete Mathematics I</b> (Lászlo Székely, A), <b>Graduate Abstract Algebra</b> (Alexander Duncan, A), <b>Discrete Optimization</b> (Joshua Cooper, A) <b>Research</b> (Tibor Jordán, ELTE, A), <b>Mathematical Problem Solving </b> (Sándor Dobos, A), <b>Measure Theory</b> (Péter Maga, Rényi Institute, B+), <b>Mathematical Foundations of Network Science</b> (Lincoln Lu, A),  <b>Analysis</b> (Ralph Howard, A), <b>Abstract Algebra II</b> (Matt Miller, A), <b>Abstract Algebra I</b> (Matt Miller, A), <b>Discrete Mathematics</b> (Lázsló Székely, A), <b>Vector Analysis</b> (Frank Thorne, A), <b>Linear Algebra</b> (Anton Schep, B+), <b>Transition to Advanced Mathematics</b> (Matt Miller, A).   </li>
